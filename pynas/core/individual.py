class Individual:
    """
    The `Individual` class represents an individual entity in the genetic algorithm or evolutionary computation context. 
    It encapsulates the architecture, chromosome, and associated properties such as fitness, IOU (Intersection over Union), 
    FPS (Frames Per Second), and model size. The class provides methods for converting between architecture and chromosome 
    representations, resetting properties, and creating deep copies of the individual.
    Attributes:
        architecture (str): The architecture code representing the individual's structure.
        chromosome (list): A list representation of the architecture code.
        parsed_layers (list): Parsed layers of the architecture code.
        fitness (float): The fitness score of the individual.
        iou (float or None): The Intersection over Union metric.
        fps (float or None): The Frames Per Second metric.
        model_size (float or None): The size of the model.
        model (object or None): The trained model associated with the individual.
    Methods:
        __init__(max_layers, min_layers=3):
            Initializes an individual with a random architecture and its corresponding chromosome.
        __str__():
            Returns a string representation of the individual.
        _reparse_layers():
            Reparses the layers of the architecture based on the chromosome.
        reset():
        architecture2chromosome(input_architecture):
            Converts an architecture code into a chromosome list.
        chromosome2architecture(input_chromosome):
            Converts a chromosome list back into an architecture code.
        copy():
            Creates a deep copy of the individual, including its properties and model.
        set_trained_model(model):
            Sets the trained model for the individual.
